# Bird Species Identification using CNN

## Project Overview

The **Bird Species Identification** project aims to classify bird species from images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The dataset consists of images of birds categorized into **220 species**. The objective is to build a deep learning model that can accurately predict the species of a bird based on an input image.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Bird Species Classification Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kedarsai/bird-species-classification-220-categories). The dataset includes:
- **220 categories** of bird species
- High-resolution images of birds (JPEG format)
- Labeled training and test data

### Key Details:
- **Number of Categories:** 220 bird species
- **Image Size:** 128x128 pixels
- **Total Images:** Over 20,000 images
- **Source:** Kaggle (available for download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kedarsai/bird-species-classification-220-categories))

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes several key libraries and frameworks:

- **Python**: Programming language used for the entire project.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning libraries for building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing (loading, resizing, and augmenting images).
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for plotting training progress and results.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations and handling image arrays.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides utility functions for model evaluation, such as metrics and confusion matrices.

# Results
The current model achieves an accuracy of 83% on the test set, which is an encouraging result for bird species classification using CNNs. Further improvements can be made by:

1. Experimenting with deeper network architectures.
2. Applying data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization.
3. Tuning hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.).
